# Docurer
A webapp that extends its abilities to the health care system.

There are all total two branches.
1. main --webapp
2. master --ml models

### BRANCH MAIN
The main branch contains all scripts for the web app.
Here's how you can clone the docurer-web:

**Firstly install gitbash to use unix command line**
refer to this video -> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BOrUHFu44A
you can use Hyper terminal or even vsCode's native terminal to use gitbash just set the terminal to _bash_

**Secondly install nvm package manager to install and use node in your machine**
refer to this video -> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDScvojqAio
use node version _18.12.1_ to avoid any conflicts

now that node has been set up on your machine. Clone this repo to get the codebase on your local:

Do the following steps:

1. cd _naviagte to your desired branch_
2. mkdir _create a folder with your desired name for eg FINALYEARPROJECT_
3. now come to terminal and do git clone https://github.com/hrishikeshghosh/Docurer.git
4. As you can see the codebase is cloned on your machine
5. before starting the server do not forget to install all the useful packages by using _**npm install**_
6. now you are ready to run server
7. **_npm run dev_** to run server

_[We use NEXTJS with SQL as our database and prisma as the OVM. Our nextjs bundle contains capabilities of ERN STACK -> EXPRESSJS, REACTJS, NODEJS]_

### BRANCH MASTER
usually we would create different branches for different ml models but master would contain the flask file and apis that would connect all the models.  [NOT YET INITIALIZED]

## DEPLOYMENT
Currently the project is under development.
